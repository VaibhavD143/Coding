LinkedList:
1) Clone linked list with radom pointers:
- use hashmap and its O(n) space
- create duplicate node after each original node, assign node.next.random = node.radom.next *traverse two nodes*,then extract LL

Tree:
1) least common ancestor:
2) Distance between two nodes in BT


DP:
1)Subset sum problem:
- sum given: take it,don't take it. O(sum*n) space and time
- is divide in two equal sum possible?: if total sum of array is odd, not possible
                            else check is totalSum//2 exist!
- give two sets :   first check if possible, from there usind dp matrix,
                    if dp[sum][i-1] is False and dp[sum][i] is True then it contributes to the sum
2) Egg dropping problem

3) Biggest sqare in matrix of 0/1
4) Biggest rectangle in matrix of 0/1(stack and queue)
5) ways to color 3D grid with 4 colors
