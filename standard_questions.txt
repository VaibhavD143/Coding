All questions from IB and leet faviourite and these!

LinkedList:
1) Clone linked list with radom pointers:
- use hashmap and its O(n) space
- create duplicate node after each original node, assign node.next.random = node.radom.next *traverse two nodes*,then extract LL

Tree:
1) least common ancestor:
2) Distance between two nodes in BT
3) In BST two nodes are swapped
    - next: do it without O(n) space
4)Construct BST/BT from preorder and inorder traversal in O(n)
5) Tree traversals iteratively
6) Subtree of another tree O(n):

Graph:
1) Two colored graph, bi-partition
2) Dijsktra with atmost k steps, https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops
3) Parallel BFS , leetcode rotting oranges

DP:
1)Subset sum problem:
- sum given: take it,don't take it. O(sum*n) space and time
- is divide in two equal sum possible?: if total sum of array is odd, not possible
                            else check is totalSum//2 exist!
- give two sets :   first check if possible, from there usind dp matrix,
                    if dp[sum][i-1] is False and dp[sum][i] is True then it contributes to the sum
2) Egg dropping problem

3) Biggest sqare in matrix of 0/1
4) Biggest rectangle in matrix of 0/1(stack and queue)
5) ways to color 3D grid with 4 colors
6) Max sum of rectangle in given matrix(leet) or submatrix with sum zero(IB) or target(leet)
7) matrix chain multiplication (burst balloons,leetcode)
8) Subset sum problem, perfect sum problem (two subset with equal average(IB), subset sum divisible by k(geek))
9) Digit DP : The Game is ON , hackerrank
10) For bitmasking : 
- 10 person and hat problem

Tricky:
1) find the duplicate , only one duplicate in an array but it can occure more than 2 times.
        -linked list cycle
2) find first duplicate in an array of size n where it contains numbers from 1-n, findfirst duplicate of array:i.e. [1,2,3,3,2] o/p : 3
        - make index value negative, youtube google search
3) stone game(leetcode) : first player always wins
                        :   for amount, use dp
4) Unique paths in grid: asked to go to right bottom from top left, can use PnC then and get answer
5) max product subarray : IB_local solution

Stack/Queue:
1) k stacks in single array : /Data Structures
2) k queues in single array : /Data Structures
