Revise:
- KMP algo
- Bit masking (hat Problem)
- inversion pair
- Egg Problem
- Graph Theory
- prims - start from src and update adjacents
- krushkal - pick minimum edge till there is n-1 edges
- shortest path in DAG - topological sort
- shortest path in DG - Dijsktra
- shortest path in DG with -ve cycle - bell man ford
- rabin karp for pattern matching

Python:
    - dict working
    - large number handaling
    - garbage collection
    - List working
    - tuple working
    - set working
    - deque
    - lambda functions
    - itertools.islice() : provide iterable and left,right boundary, just a slicing tool
- https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/discuss/43295/Detailed-explanation-and-generalization-of-the-bitwise-operation-method-for-single-numbers

To-Do:
- Median of two sorted array
- Meet in the middle
- Python:
    - itertools.tee #find kth smallest sum of sorted matrix 76ms solution
- Randomised (n/5) algo for finding median 
- Z-array algo
- sortedcontainers for BST

- Multi-threading concept
`- What is JDBC?



Idea:
- pop in tuple cancel : mutability will go away and that will make it vunerable in dictionary
- slicing in deque
- updation in heap cancel: O(n) operation
