mother vertex:
    - A vertex u from which there exists path to every other vertex
    algo:
        - apply DFS from any vertex and keep trace of last finished vertex v
        - now, if mother vertex exist in a graph then v is one of them
        - apply DFS from v and if it reaches all the nodes then that's out mother vertex
    
Topological sort:
    - DFS :
        - DFS on graph, add to the stack after visiting all the adjacents
        - topological order : starting from the last added element
    - Kahn's Algorithm:
        - in-degree and out-degree count of the nodes(Kahn's Algorithm)

Strongly Connected Graph:
	- A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices. A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph.
    - Is SC?
        - Undirected Graph:
            - DFS from any node
        - Directed Graph:
            - Leverage Kosarjun's Algorithm : DFS from v (all nodes are reachable from v), transpose of graph, again DFS from v(v is reachable from all the nodes)

    - Strongly connected components:
        - Directed Graph:
            - Kosarjun's Algo:
                - DFS over all the nodes, add to the stack after visiting adjacents
                - transpose graph
                - Pop node from stack and do DFS. each iteration will give one SCC.

            - Tarjan's Algo:
                - 

DFS Applicatins:
- path finding(not shortes path)
- check wether graph is bipartite(can be divided into two sets, where no edge within a set):
	assign alternate color, if any clash then not bi-pi graph
- topological sort
- Detecting cycle in directed Graph or undirected:
	if back edge exist! 
- strongly connected components

BFS Applicatins:
- Shortest path between two nodes
- in a web crawler
- peer to peer network like BitTorrent
- Social Networking website
- Broadcasting : Broadcast through nearest node available
- GPS : finds neares node 
- Cycle Detection in directed graph:
    - count in-degree
    - iterate on 0 in-degree nodes and decreament their neighbours
    - if all are visited then False,else True

Euclrean path:
- visit all edges excatly once
Euclrean CKT:
- visit all edges excatly once and start and end are same vertex
