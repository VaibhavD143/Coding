mother vertex:
    - a vertex u from which there exists path to every other vertex
    algo:
        - apply DFS from any vertex and keep trace of last finished vertex v
        - now, if mother vertex exist in a graph then v is one of them
        - apply DFS from v and if it reaches all the nodes then that's out mother vertex
    
Topological sort:
    - can be done using in-degree and out-degree count of the nodes(Kahn's Algorithm)
