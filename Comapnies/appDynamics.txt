*) There are several factors that affect the efficiency of lookup operations in a hash table.
Which of the following is not one of those factors?
A. Number of elements stored in the hash table
_. Size of elements stored in the hash table
C. Number of buckets in the hash table
D. Quality of the hash function
E. All of the above factors affect the efficiency of hash table lookups 

*) 
int a = 2;
float b = 3;
double c = 445;
long d = 45432;

expression (a+b)*(c+d) will cast to?
_: double, expression doesn't matter
long double > double > float > unsigned long long > long long > unsigned long > long > unsigned int > int

*) Program counter start with address 200 and instruction size is 24-bit then legal adress would be multiple of 3(24/8=3)
230
215
not 220
not 225

*)How many variables are suffiecient for below expression in three address code?
q+r/3+s−t∗5+u∗v/w
t1=r/3; 
t2=t∗5;
t3=u∗v;
t4=t3/w;
t5=q+t1;
t6=t5+s;
t7=t6−t2;
t8=t7+t4
ans: >=8
